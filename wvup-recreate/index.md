### WVUP recreate

Try to recreate the wvup.edu landing page. This doesnt mean an interpretation of the site...but imagine someone gave you that design and you had to build it.  


#### Do's
* Create the header menu links (remember `position:fixed` helps keep items *stuck* in a location)
* Try to get dropdowns working on hover of menu item
* Use DevTools to match colors and gradients and such


#### Dont's
* Copy their CSS classes
* Dont copy and paste their structure...its kind of funky anyhow
* Dont worry about making a working calendar
* Dont make 1 million sub menu items for each drop down.
