## Additional Instructions after reviewing storyboard
---------  

dorr storyboard RoaneBooster2

Site can be done for any school, team, etc….just has to have the same nav structure and achieve the same goals.

News, Directory, FAQ are up to each student to implement how they want. Spend most of your time getting the forms and that section working and finish up with the new/directory/faq section

Merge registration and parent information forms to simplify structure (Slides 6 and 7).
Ensure password validation and compare passwords (keyup, submit, whatever events)

Post-Registration and Login will both land you on setting up child accounts.  This needs to allow end user to select/enter how many students they are creating forms for.  This will generate the same markup for each student (can be one long page, accordion, tabs, etc.,)

Completing the form will then display  (render)  ‘printable’ markup that merges the parent information with each student.
